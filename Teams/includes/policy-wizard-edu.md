> You can run the [Teams for Education Policy Wizard](../easy-policy-setup-edu.md) to easily apply policies for your students, educators and staff. The tool adjusts the Global (Org-wide default) policy definition of a core set of policies with settings that we recommend for student safety and applies it to students. The tool also creates and assigns a set of custom policies to educators and staff. If you already used the wizard to apply policies for your students, educators and staff, use this article as a reference or *only* if you want to manually create and manage policies for your students, educators and staff.
